MSc Dissertation project 2025 - A fundamental test of models of galaxy evolution

The aim of this project is to test for the presence of radio-mode feedback in quenched galaxies, using both the first data release of LOFAR LBA Sky Survey (LoLSS, https://lofar-surveys.org/lolss.html) and a value-added catalogue from the Sloane Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).

As a rough plan for the project, I am to:
  - Infer a catalogue of quenched galaxies from the SFR and galaxy masses
  - Match these quenched galaxies to radio sources in the LoLSS survey
  - Using the complementary subset to the above (quenched galaxies which are *not* identified radio sources), determine if there is collective evidence for radio signals from these galaxies, against survey noise. To achieve this, I aim to use stacking analysis to average the signals from the ~15000 sources, and use Monte Carlo simulation to obtain estimates for baseline noise and error in the survey.
